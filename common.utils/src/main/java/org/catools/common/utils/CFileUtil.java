/**

 *
 * <p>General file manipulation utilities. 1- Automation is internal tools and end user totally have
 * control on flow. 2- Also, the test automation flow usually cross several app tier and uses
 * different utils. Being said, having unchecked exceptions will impact code readability and large
 * list of throws on test methods. To avoid it we wrap some FileUtils methods to throw specific
